## Irene Canuti

After years working  as a Project Manager - juggling between Tech, Design and Marketing - I realised something very simple: I am a Maker.   
I like making things real, from ideation to implementation. I love graphic design and coding, product design, 3D printing, playing with hardware and DIY projects, but also project management, business and iterative development.   

I am a traveler and I lived and worked in Italy, China and UK.   

Internet has always been my natural environment. A place where one can build and see ideas grow and spread quickly.

I feel comfortable with uncertainty because is raw material, everything is possible.

I started my own business because I want to make an impact
It only takes a adaptivity, strategy, intuition and great motivation.

I am looking for innovative and interesting projects and amazing teams to collaborate with. An environment where I will never stop learning and be surprised.

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.
