## Irene Canuti

After working as a Project Manager - juggling between Tech, Design and Marketing - I realised something very simple: I am a Maker. I like making things real, from ideation to implementation. I like listening and telling stories, and I love communication design, coding, hardware and 3D printing, and also product development and iterative development.   

The digital world is a place where one can see products evolve, and ideas grow and spread quickly. I joined Makers Academy because I want to be part of this world with what I design and build every day.

I love travelling, I lived and worked in Italy, China and the UK. I am now looking for interesting projects and amazing teams to work with.

## Skills

### Personal Skills

**Curious Quick learner**   
I pick up on things quickly. During the Alexa Skill project I embraced a whole new tech stack in 2 weeks, learning and implementing solutions on the go. Also, during my BA I learned graphic and web design online. A hobby that led me to freelance for charities and organisations such as the Italian Red Cross.

**Team player**   
Collaboration forces us to consider different ways of looking at issues. It can be tough when there are different skill levels and personalities in the room, so I found trying out things and have honest discussions around validated learning to be a gamechanger.

**Natural planner**   
During Unlimited Lab's R&D phase I was able to break down tasks, anticipate challenges and time frames for the development of the product, at the same time communicating effectively with the team and adapting the overall plan based on findings and feedback.

**Researcher**  
My passion for research in any field has always helped my strategic and creative thinking in work and life when making informed decisions. As a Guest Lecturer in a Business School I was able to find resources to support a more qualitative, impactful and value-driven approach to doing business.

**Dots-connector**  
I am good at finding connections between different domains and disciplines. It is the way to innovation I believe. At Togada Studio, I helped the founders find their real fit to market pivoting towards a different business model, also improving the overall happiness of their team.

**Problem solver**   
I feel comfortable with uncertainty because it is raw material: everything is possible. For example, when developing a 3D printed gadget, I helped the lead designer rethinking the structure to be self-supportive, thus saving material and printing time and also giving the object a distinctive design.

**Adaptive**  
I adapt quickly based on needs. As an example, I was hired as Web Marketing Assistant at yousporty.com but when I left I was actually organizing the day-to-day work of their web development team.

**"Carer"**  
I care about the quality of the code I write, I care about the people I work with, I care about business and users’ needs, and I care about the value I can deliver doing what I love the best way possible.
